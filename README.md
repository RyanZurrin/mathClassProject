# mathClassProject
got things with 2d and 3d vectors mostly working okay

This was a project I was working on in my c++ 2 class. I wanted to build a calculator that could do calculus. I did not know what I was doing when I started but learned a lot
along the way. I wanted to learn how to work between classes as well, so I started to add in the different shape classes so I could do math and figure out geometric stuff as well.
I wanted a calculator that could do it all but along the way I got lost and gave up trying to build my own implementation and was trying to connect to existing math libraries to 
use the hard to implement stuff that was already made, but that ended up taking a lot more than i realized as well and because the project had a due date I had to change up plans and 
jsut try to get something working that could prove I understood the concepts we had learned in class so that was what i ultimatly did. So this is a in progress project and i feel has 
potential and could be something cool if I just put a little more work into it.
