# mathClassProject

This is a final project for my c++ II class that is supposed to be a CLI calculator to solve calculus and complex mathematical problems,
with a focus on vector and computational geometry. My initial goal was to make a calculator that would give you back the real answers in 
real number form like 2pi/3 or √2/2 instead of the decimal notation or pure fraction i would like it returned in terms of pi and with √'s.
For this task I was planning on using excel to make some really big lookup tables that I could somehow build a class or function to convert
that would use some searching algorithms to search the tables in an fast efficient manner and then return the appropriate conversion. As well 
after searching for easy to integrate mathematical libraries for calculus and not finding anything too simple It was my intention to build a 
simple header file library with and intuitive interface with a cli for testing functions and object creation within the math engine.

I welcome any and all constructive criticism. As one new to c++ and just learning how all this works I am sure there will be things
that I could be doing better and if anyone so stumbles upon this project and so decides it is a worthy cause of their time and aid i would only 
be indebted and truly grateful for any wisdom and age-old best practices that I should be practicing. Thank you all in advance for the time and 
advice you may have for an old dog learning some new tricks.
